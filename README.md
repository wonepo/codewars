#### [My Solution](https://github.com/wonepo/codewars/blob/main/Kata1.java)  
###### JAVA LISTS ARRAYS FUNDAMENTALS

Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

### Example:
```java
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
```
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
